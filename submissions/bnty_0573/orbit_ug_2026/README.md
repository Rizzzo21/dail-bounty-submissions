## The claim, in one line

For `E : y² = x³ − x`,

```
    L(E,1) · 4²  =  Omega_E · 2        (to within 1e-40)
```

where `4` is the number of rational torsion points (proved below), `2` is
the product of the Tamagawa numbers (computed below), `Omega_E` is the real
period over the whole real locus (computed below by three independent
algorithms), and `L(E,1)` is the L-value (computed below). Equivalently,
the BSD formula gives `#Sha(E) = 1`, which is the published value.

## The documents

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| [`PROOF.md`](PROOF.md) | the mathematics: the identity, the descent, the Tamagawa number, the period, the L-value, and what is open |
| [`CLAIMS.md`](CLAIMS.md) | **every claim, with its status**: PROVED / COMPUTED / CITED / OPEN, and where each is checked |
| [`OPEN_REMAINDER.md`](OPEN_REMAINDER.md) | precisely what this does **not** establish |
| `data/pari-32a2.txt` | PARI/GP transcript — the independent numerical oracle |
| `data/ecdata-32a2.txt` | John Cremona's `ecdata` rows — the independent database oracle |

## The code

| file | what it does |
|---|---|
| `src/cert.py` | certified interval arithmetic (fixed-point, directed rounding) — no floating point anywhere in a certified path |
| `src/a_n.py` | the newform coefficients `a_n`, computed **two ways**: point counting on `E/𝔽_p` and the eta product `η(4z)²η(8z)²` |
| `src/lvalue.py` | `L(E,1)` from the Fricke exponential sum, with Deligne's bound for a rigorous tail estimate |
| `src/period.py` | `Ω_E` by **three independent routes** — AGM, hypergeometric series, theta series — required to agree |
| `src/tate.py` | Tate's algorithm at `p = 2` (exact integer arithmetic) → Kodaira type III, `c₂ = 2` |
| `src/identity.py` | the BSD identity itself, in certified interval arithmetic |
| `src/sha2.py` | the 2-descent certificate that `Sha(E)[2] = 0`, with a control on PARI's own worked example |
| `src/identity_data.py` | every constant used, each labelled PROVED / COMPUTED / CITED |

## Where this repository lives

This directory is a **self-contained git repository** with its own
history (five commits, all of them this work). The **published** copy of
exactly this tree is what matters, and it is published at three
independent, content-addressed locations:

| what | where | how to check |
|---|---|---|
| **clone source** (git) | `https://bsd-32a2.surge.sh/bsd-32a2.git` | `git clone https://bsd-32a2.surge.sh/bsd-32a2.git` |
| source tarball | `https://pomf2.lain.la/f/eeh5pory.tar.gz` | `sha256sum` → compare with the value in `RELEASE.txt` |
| git bundle (all refs) | `https://pomf2.lain.la/f/z4o3v7sq.bundle` | `git bundle verify`; `git clone` it |

**The exact commit and the SHA-256 of each published file are recorded in
`RELEASE.txt`, published beside the clone source**, and quoted verbatim in
the DAiL submission. They are deliberately *not* written here: a hash of
this tree cannot live inside this tree. Re-download the tarball, re-hash
it, and compare against `RELEASE.txt`; if it matches, you have bit-for-bit
what was submitted.

> The `pomf2.lain.la` copies are content-addressed: the URL changes if the
> bytes change, so the URL alone is not evidence — the SHA-256 is.
> The `surge.sh` clone source is served as a plain **dumb-HTTP** git
> repository (`git update-server-info`), so it works with a plain
> `git clone` and needs no smart-HTTP server and no credentials.

## How to verify

No network, no PARI required, no dependencies beyond CPython 3.

```bash
./verify.sh                  # 11 steps; exits non-zero if anything disagrees
./tests/mutation_tests.sh    # 11 corruptions; requires verify.sh to FAIL on each
```

`verify.sh` checks the certified results against **external** ground truth:
the committed PARI/GP transcript and the committed `ecdata` rows (both
*parsed out of the files*, so a corrupted transcript is detected rather than
silently compared against a private copy), plus the closed forms and the
three independent period routes.

`tests/mutation_tests.sh` is the part that makes a PASS meaningful. It
corrupts the inputs one at a time and **requires `verify.sh` to fail**. A
harness that cannot fail is not a harness. The current state:

```
MUTATION TESTS: 11/11 corruptions detected
```

including the subtle ones — a loosened tolerance, a neutered consistency
check, a removed cross-check, and a swapped period convention.

### Optional: the PARI/GP 2-descent certificate

`src/sha2.py` needs PARI/GP. `verify.sh` runs it when `gp` is on `PATH` and
otherwise skips it with a clear message; the committed transcript is in
`data/sha2-certificate.txt`.

## Why the numbers are believable

Every quantity has at least two independent derivations that must agree:

| quantity | derivation A | derivation B | derivation C | external oracle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Ω_E` | AGM | hypergeometric series | theta series | PARI (60 digits), Cremona `allbsd` |
| `L(E,1)` | Fricke/point-counting | — | — | PARI `ellL1` (60 digits) |
| `a_n` | point counting | eta product | — | published `a_p` values |
| `c₂ = 2` | Tate's algorithm (ours) | — | — | PARI `elllocalred`, Cremona `allbsd` |
| `rank 0`, `#tors = 4` | Fermat descent (ours) | — | — | PARI `ellrank`/`elltors`, Cremona `allcurves` |
| `Sha[2] = 0` | 2-descent (ours, with control) | — | — | PARI `ellrank` bounds |

## Three things worth knowing before you cite this

1. **The period convention is a trap, and it is guarded.** `E(ℝ)` has two
   connected components. Using the identity component's period instead of
   the full real locus's period would imply `#Sha(E) = 2`, which is false.
   `src/identity.py` **asserts** that the identity-component period gives
   2, so a silent change of convention cannot pass. `PROOF.md` §1.1.

2. **The LMFDB label is `32.a3`, not `32.a2`.** LMFDB and Cremona order
   isogeny classes differently, so LMFDB's `32.a2` is the *different* curve
   `[0,0,0,-11,14]` (Cremona 32a4). Verified against Cremona's own
   `alllabels` file.

3. **PARI's `ellrank` output `s = 0` does NOT prove `Sha[2] = 0`.** Per
   `??ellrank`, `s` is only a *minoration* of the 2-rank; `(ℤ/4)²` has
   `s = 0` and 2-rank 2. The valid inference uses the rank bounds
   `r = R = 0` and the identity `C = T + R + S`. `src/sha2.py` implements
   exactly that, with a control on PARI's own worked example.
   `PROOF.md` §7.
